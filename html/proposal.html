        <h4>Proposal</h4>
        <h5>Introduction</h5>
        <p>
            Today more than 24,000 Starbucks stores are in business around the globe, all serving the infamous and overpriced Starbucks coffee. <a href="https://news.starbucks.com/news">[1]</a> Last year Starbucks reported an 11% increase
            in revenue in comparison to the 2015 fiscal year – amounting to a total net revenue of $21.3 billion for fiscal 2016.<a href="http://investor.starbucks.com/financial-information/supplemental-financial-data/default.aspx">[2]</a>                                Starbucks has been in business since 1971 when the company opened their first location in Seattle and hasn’t stopped expanding since. Starbucks franchises are all over America, sometimes within blocks of each other in heavily
            populated cities.
        </p>

        <h5>Current Situation</h5>
        <p>
            We have obtained a dataset containing some location attributes of all Starbucks franchise locations in the world, a data set detailing income by zip code, and a data set covering diversity by city and state in the U.S. The combined information in these
            data sets will allow our team to analyze trends pertaining to store location, demographic diversity, and income diversity to see if any relationship between the three exists.

            <ul class='mdl-list'>
                <h6>Some questions we would like to answer include:</h6>
                <li class="mdl-list__item">How are the locations of Starbucks stores related to the average income?</li>
                <li class="mdl-list__item">How are the locations of Starbucks stores related to the diversity of a region?</li>
                <li class="mdl-list__item">What areas have the highest/lowest Starbucks store density?</li>
            </ul>

            Some more interesting finds may continue to show themselves as we query the available data and set each data set up against each other.

        </p>

        <h5> Project Plan</h5>
        <p>
            To start this project, we will first set up a database using MySQL and Python, along with MySQL’s Python database driver. Rather than hosting the database on a server, we will instead write scripts that will automatically set up this environment on our
            team member’s personal machines. The necessary tables and relationships are created as necessary to model the data in our datasets, parsing and cleaning the data as needed. All aspects of this project will be hosted on
            GitHub, and will be publicly available. We will also use GitHub to host a static website that will display results from our data analysis and show off any interesting information we uncover, as well as any relationships
            between the data that are found.
